    "# Run ATB LCOE pipeline\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook is used to run the ATB data processing pipeline and extract data from the ATB electricity data workbook. \n",
    "Prior to running this notebook, the ATB workbooks need to be updated. This is done in three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adjust the tax incentive levels from the raw values to reflect the variety of IRA incentive levels:\n",
    "    1. No IRA: No ITC or PTC for any technologies\n",
    "    2. Base IRA: 6% ITC or \\$5/MWh PTC\n",
    "    3. IRA with wage requirements: 30% ITC or \\$26/MWh PTC\n",
    "    4. IRA with one bonus: 40% ITC or \\$29/MWh PTC\n",
    "    5. IRA with both bonuses: 50% ITC or \\$32/MWh PTC\n",
    "3. After updating tax incentive levels, run the [Update Debt Fractions](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Documents%2FATB-calc%2FUpdate%20Debt%20Fractions.ipynb) Jupyter notebook to calculate the expected debt to equity ratio based on the incentive levels.\n",
    "4. Copy the new debt fractions into the ATB workbooks from the workbooks created by the \"Update Debt Fractions\" notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the previous steps are completed, save the ATB workbooks and return to this script to extract the values.\n",
    "\n",
